## Root

- The root directory is the top-level directory in the hierarchy of the file system.

Root user home directory is /root

## /bin

## /usr

- usr folder is know as **user** folder

### Why ?

`Historically`

- because of storage limitation it was split to root binary folders and user binary folders

/usr/local

- This folder is used to store the locally installed software.

if you install java software than the binary files will be stored in /usr/local/java/bin and library files will be stored in /usr/local/java/lib.

- pogram installed here, will be available to all users

`you can install software to specific user`

## /opt

- opt folder is know as **optional** folder
- This folder is used to store the third party software or application software.

The differnce between usr/local dir and the opt dir is that programs , which NOT split its components.
