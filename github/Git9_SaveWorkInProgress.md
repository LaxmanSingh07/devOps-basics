## SAVE WORK-IN-PROGRESS CHANGES (STASH)

`git stash` : save work-in-progress changes (stash)

This command is useful when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.


`git stash pop` : apply the most recently stashed changes to the working directory


## Another Use Case for stashing 

- Making changes to the current branch

- Notice that somethings is wrong

- So hide changes temporarily with `git stash`

- Brin changes back with `git stash pop`
