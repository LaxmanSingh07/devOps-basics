## What is Merge Conflict?

`Merge Conflict` occurs when two branches have changed the same part of the same file, and then those branches are merged together.

 For example, if you make a change to a file, and your colleague working in the same repository also makes a change, then when your colleague pushes their changes up to GitHub, you won't be able to pull those changes down until you resolve the merge conflict.


## How to avoid Merge Conflict?

- **Pull frequently** to avoid merge conflicts

`commands`

`git pull -r` : pull and rebase (rebase is a way to move commits to the tip of a branch)
