## Concept of Branches in Git


- `Master branch` - the main branch of the repository (By default)

- What's the state of the repo ?

`Dfferent branches` - different versions of the code (Which will allow different developers to work on different versions of the code)

- `git branch` - check the branches in the repository  


## Concept of Branches 

- best practice : 1 branch per bugfix or feature
- Developers can commit without worrying to break main branch (master branch)

`After creating a branch`- a devloper can merge the branch to master branch

`big fature branches long open, incrase the chance of merge confilcts`


`git branch <branch name>` - create a branch

`git checkout <branch name>` - switch to a branch

`git branch` :  `*` - current branch
'git pull' - pull the changes from remote repository
